Hermes
------

A cakephp shell intended to allow communication with Chat Services.
Currently only works with Yahoo Messenger with messenger-sdk-php.

Thanks to @neterslandreau for the name.

Configuration
-------------

Retrieve messenger-sdk-php submodule:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Configure your bot

	Check example configuration in config/bots.default.php.  You need to get
	your consumer and secret key from http://developers.yahoo.com.

	Once your bots are configured, start it by issuing:

		cake bots start <bot_nick>

	There's only one bot: LameBot. You can find it in libs/bots/lame_bot.php.
	It responds to incoming message that begins with 'about', and it will read
	all files from $config['outgoing_directory]:

		APP/tmp/outgoing/<outgoing_prefix>*.out

	and send them out.  These files are automatically deleted once processed.

	The .out files are TAB separated and contain two fields:

		- destination nick
		- message

Btw, if you use this to spam, Kratos will hunt you down. :)

Good luck and have fun.
